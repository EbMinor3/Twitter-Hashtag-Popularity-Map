Political Hashtag Popularity Map
Displays locations of recent Twitter hashtags from #ImWithHer, #Trump2016, #GaryJohnson2016, and #JillStein. The height of the bars indicates the recency of the tweet.

This application is in no way supposed to be biased for or against any candidate. I believe that the stated hashtags are the most common/popular for the supporters of the respective candidates.
